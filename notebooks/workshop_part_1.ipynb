    "## Receiving responses from the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph provides flexibility in how you can handle responses from the LLM. You can choose between implementing an **async streaming API** for a better user experience (as if the LLM types back) or processing responses synchronously for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Async Streaming API\n",
    "\n",
    "The async streaming API allows you to stream responses incrementally as they are generated. This is particularly useful for creating a more interactive and responsive chatbot. To implement this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `astream` method provided by LangGraph.\n",
    "2. Properly `await` the necessary coroutines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async for msg, metadata in agent.astream(\n",
    "    dict(messages=\"Some query\"),\n",
    "    stream_mode=\"messages\",\n",
    "    config=RunnableConfig(\n",
    "        callbacks=[cl.AsyncLangchainCallbackHandler()],\n",
    "        configurable=...,\n",
    "    ),\n",
    "):\n",
    "    print(f\"Msg: {msg}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Metadata: {metadata}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronous API\n",
    "\n",
    "If simplicity is your priority, you can process the response in one go. This approach is easier to implement but may result in a slight delay before the user sees the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = agent.invoke(dict(messages=\"Some query\"))\n",
    "print(response)\n",
