# Building an Agent-Based Chatbot

## Project Description

A workshop, templated from [@DatacationOrg/chatbot-workshop](https://github.com/DatacationOrg/chatbot-workshop),
to learn to build capable agents using LangChain and Gemini.

This project guides you through building a powerful agent-based chatbot using LangChain and LangGraph.
The implementation progresses from a basic LLM-powered chatbot to a sophisticated agent with tools and memory.

## Dependencies

- langchain
- langgraph
- chainlit
- python-dotenv
- langchain-google-genai
- jupyter
- nbconvert
- datasets
- pandas
- sqlalchemy

## Notes

- The notebooks are for experimentation
- Final implementation should be in `chat_app.py`
- Remember to handle API keys securely
- Consider implementing proper error handling
- Add logging for better debugging
- Use `notebook_1` or `notebook_2` to execute notebooks in place via cli.

## About ReAct

ReAct does not refer to a React.js application, but rather a Python-based agent system that follows the ReAct pattern for
intelligent decision-making.

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a framework for building AI agents that combines:

1. Reasoning: The agent thinks through problems step by step
2. Acting: The agent uses tools to gather information and perform actions
3. Observing: The agent learns from the results of its actions

In this project, ReAct is implemented using:

- Chainlit for the chat interface
- LangChain for the agent framework
- Custom tools for data analysis and search
