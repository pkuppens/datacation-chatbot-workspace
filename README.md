# Building an Agent-Based Chatbot

This project guides you through building a powerful agent-based chatbot using LangChain and LangGraph.
The implementation progresses from a basic LLM-powered chatbot to a sophisticated agent with tools and memory.

## Project Plan

### Part 1: Basic Setup and Integration âœ…

- [x] Environment and dependencies setup
- [x] Basic chatbot implementation
- [x] LangGraph integration
- [x] Streaming response handling
- [x] Basic tool integration (DuckDuckGo search)
- [x] Memory and checkpointing
- [x] Code quality and security measures

### Part 2: Advanced Agent Capabilities ðŸš€

#### 1. Enhanced Tool Integration

- [ ] Implement custom tools:
  - [ ] Weather tool with structured output
  - [ ] Calculator with math operations
  - [ ] File operations tool
  - [ ] Custom search tool with better formatting

#### 2. Improved Response Handling

- [ ] Implement response formatting:
  - [ ] Markdown support
  - [ ] Code block highlighting
  - [ ] Table formatting
  - [ ] List formatting
- [ ] Add response validation
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery

#### 3. Advanced Memory Management

- [ ] Implement long-term memory:
  - [ ] File-based storage
  - [ ] Database integration
  - [ ] Memory summarization
- [ ] Add context management:
  - [ ] Context window optimization
  - [ ] Relevant memory retrieval
  - [ ] Memory pruning

#### 4. Agent Reasoning and Planning

- [ ] Implement ReAct framework:
  - [ ] Thought process visualization
  - [ ] Action planning
  - [ ] Result evaluation
- [ ] Add multi-step reasoning:
  - [ ] Break down complex tasks
  - [ ] Tool chaining
  - [ ] Result aggregation

#### 5. User Experience Enhancements

- [ ] Add interactive elements:
  - [ ] Buttons for common actions
  - [ ] File upload support
  - [ ] Image generation/display
- [ ] Implement feedback system:
  - [ ] Response rating
  - [ ] Error reporting
  - [ ] Usage analytics

#### 6. Testing and Monitoring

- [ ] Add comprehensive testing:
  - [ ] Unit tests for tools
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Implement monitoring:
  - [ ] Performance metrics
  - [ ] Error tracking
  - [ ] Usage statistics

## Dependencies

- langchain
- langgraph
- chainlit
- python-dotenv
- langchain-google-genai

## Notes

- The notebooks are for experimentation
- Final implementation should be in `chat_app.py`
- Remember to handle API keys securely
- Consider implementing proper error handling
- Add logging for better debugging
