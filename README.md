# Building an Agent-Based Chatbot

A workshop, templated from [@DatacationOrg/chatbot-workshop](https://github.com/DatacationOrg/chatbot-workshop),
to learn to build capable agents using LangChain and Gemini.

This project guides you through building a powerful agent-based chatbot using LangChain and LangGraph.
The implementation progresses from a basic LLM-powered chatbot to a sophisticated agent with tools and memory.

## Project Plan

### Part 1: Basic Setup and Integration âœ…

- [x] Environment and dependencies setup
- [x] Basic chatbot implementation
- [x] LangGraph integration
- [x] Streaming response handling
- [x] Basic tool integration (DuckDuckGo search)
- [x] Memory and checkpointing
- [x] Code quality and security measures
- [x] Notebook execution and configuration management
  - [x] In-place notebook execution
  - [x] Chainlit configuration centralization
  - [x] Environment variable management
  - [x] Project root detection

### Part 2: Advanced Agent Capabilities ðŸš€

#### 1. Enhanced Tool Integration

## Dependencies

- langchain
- langgraph
- chainlit
- python-dotenv
- langchain-google-genai
- jupyter
- nbconvert

## Notes

- The notebooks are for experimentation
- Final implementation should be in `chat_app.py`
- Remember to handle API keys securely
- Consider implementing proper error handling
- Add logging for better debugging
- Use `notebook_1.py` to run notebooks with proper configuration
