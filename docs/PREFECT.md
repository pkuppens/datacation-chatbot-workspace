# Prefect in the Chatbot Workshop Project

## What is Prefect?

Prefect is a modern workflow orchestration tool that helps you build, schedule, and monitor data pipelines.
It's particularly well-suited for data engineering tasks and provides a robust framework for managing complex workflows.

Key features include:

- Task and flow management
- Caching and retries
- Error handling
- Monitoring and logging
- Distributed execution
- Cloud-native deployment options

## Prefect in Our Project

### Current Usage

In our project, Prefect is used to manage the Titanic dataset pipeline. The implementation can be found in `data_pipeline/titanic_pipeline.py`.

#### Understanding Tasks and Flows

Tasks and Flows are the fundamental building blocks of Prefect workflows:

1. **Tasks**
   - Tasks are the smallest unit of work in Prefect
   - Each task should do one specific thing
   - Tasks can be cached, retried, and monitored independently
   - Tasks can pass data to other tasks

   Example from our project:

   ```python
   @task(cache_key_fn=task_input_hash, cache_expiration=timedelta(hours=1))
   def download_titanic_dataset() -> Path:
       """Download the Titanic dataset if it doesn't exist."""
       if not TITANIC_CSV_PATH.exists():
           try:
               # Try to get dataset from Hugging Face
               dataset = load_dataset("mstz/titanic")["train"]
               df = dataset.to_pandas()
               df.to_csv(TITANIC_CSV_PATH, index=False)
           except Exception as e:
               # Fallback to direct CSV download
               response = requests.get(TITANIC_CSV_URL)
               response.raise_for_status()
               TITANIC_CSV_PATH.write_text(response.text)
       return TITANIC_CSV_PATH
   ```

   This task:
   - Has a single responsibility: downloading the dataset
   - Returns a Path object that other tasks can use
   - Includes error handling and fallback logic
   - Is cached to prevent unnecessary downloads

2. **Flows**
   - Flows are the orchestrators that combine tasks into a workflow
   - They define the sequence and dependencies between tasks
   - They handle the overall execution and error handling
   - They can be scheduled, monitored, and versioned

   Example from our project:

   ```python
   @flow(name="Titanic Data Pipeline")
   def run_titanic_pipeline() -> Path:
       """Run the complete Titanic data pipeline."""
       # First task: Download the dataset
       csv_path = download_titanic_dataset()
       
       # Second task: Convert to SQLite
       db_path = convert_to_sqlite(csv_path)
       
       return db_path
   ```

   This flow:
   - Defines the sequence of operations
   - Passes data between tasks (csv_path â†’ convert_to_sqlite)
   - Handles the overall execution
   - Returns the final result

3. **How They Work Together**

   ```python
   # Task 1: Download data
   @task
   def download_data() -> pd.DataFrame:
       return pd.read_csv("data.csv")
   
   # Task 2: Process data
   @task
   def process_data(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
       return df.clean()
   
   # Task 3: Save results
   @task
   def save_results(df: pd.DataFrame) -> Path:
       return df.to_csv("results.csv")
   
   # Flow: Orchestrate the tasks
   @flow
   def data_pipeline():
       # Execute tasks in sequence
       raw_data = download_data()
       processed_data = process_data(raw_data)
       result_path = save_results(processed_data)
       
       # Return the final result
       return result_path
   ```

   The flow:
   1. Calls `download_data()` and gets a DataFrame
   2. Passes that DataFrame to `process_data()`
   3. Takes the processed DataFrame and passes it to `save_results()`
   4. Returns the path to the saved results

   Prefect automatically:
   - Tracks the execution of each task
   - Handles errors at any step
   - Caches results when possible
   - Provides monitoring and logging

### Pipeline Structure

Our Titanic pipeline consists of three main tasks:

1. `download_titanic_dataset`: Downloads data from Hugging Face or falls back to direct CSV
2. `convert_to_sqlite`: Converts the CSV to SQLite database
3. `load_titanic_data`: Loads the data into memory as a pandas DataFrame

The pipeline is orchestrated by the `run_titanic_pipeline` flow, which ensures proper sequencing and error handling.

## Project Architecture and Development

### Separation of Concerns

The introduction of Prefect in our project has enabled a clean separation between data pipeline management and LLM agent functionality:

1. **Data Pipeline Layer**
   - Managed by Prefect
   - Handles data acquisition, transformation, and storage
   - Independent of the LLM implementation
   - Can be modified without affecting the agent logic

2. **LLM Agent Layer**
   - Focuses on natural language processing and reasoning
   - Consumes data through well-defined interfaces
   - Doesn't need to know about data pipeline implementation details

This separation allows us to:

- Modify the data pipeline without touching the LLM code
- Update the LLM implementation without affecting data handling
- Test each layer independently
- Scale and optimize each component separately

### Development Workflow

During development, the pipeline updates automatically when source files change:

1. **Local Development**

   ```python
   # Changes to data_pipeline/titanic_pipeline.py
   # are automatically picked up by Prefect
   @task
   def new_task():
       # New implementation
   ```

   - No need to rebuild or restart the pipeline
   - Changes are reflected immediately
   - Cache is automatically invalidated when task code changes

2. **Cache Management**
   - Task results are cached based on code and input parameters
   - Changing task code automatically invalidates the cache
   - Cache expiration (1 hour in our case) provides a safety net

3. **Testing Changes**

   ```bash
   # Run the pipeline to test changes
   uv run titanic-pipeline
   ```

   - Immediate feedback on pipeline changes
   - Clear error messages if something goes wrong
   - Easy to verify data transformations

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Pipeline code is versioned with the project
   - Changes require a new deployment
   - Cache can be cleared if needed

This development workflow makes it easy to:

- Iterate quickly on data pipeline changes
- Test modifications without complex setup
- Maintain data consistency
- Debug pipeline issues

## Future Recommendations

### Potential Prefect Features to Consider

1. **Deployment Management**
   - Use Prefect's deployment features to schedule regular data updates
   - Deploy to cloud environments for better scalability
   - Set up monitoring and alerts for pipeline failures

2. **State Management**

   ```python
   from prefect.states import State
   from prefect.artifacts import create_markdown_artifact
   ```

   - Track pipeline state changes
   - Create artifacts for pipeline results
   - Implement state-based retries

3. **Parallel Execution**

   ```python
   @task(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=60)
   def process_data_chunk(chunk):
       # Process data in parallel
   ```

   - Process large datasets in parallel
   - Implement chunked processing for better performance
   - Use task mapping for parallel execution

4. **Monitoring and Logging**

   ```python
   from prefect.logging import get_run_logger
   
   @task
   def monitored_task():
       logger = get_run_logger()
       logger.info("Task started")
   ```

   - Implement detailed logging
   - Set up monitoring dashboards
   - Create custom metrics for pipeline performance

5. **Storage and Caching**

   ```python
   from prefect.filesystems import LocalFileSystem
   from prefect.storage import FileSystem
   ```

   - Use different storage backends (S3, GCS, etc.)
   - Implement distributed caching
   - Set up result storage for long-running tasks

6. **API Integration**

   ```python
   from prefect.client import get_client
   
   async def get_pipeline_status():
       async with get_client() as client:
           # Interact with Prefect API
   ```

   - Create API endpoints for pipeline control
   - Implement webhooks for pipeline events
   - Build custom UI components

### Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Monitoring and logging for better observability
   - State management for robust error handling
   - Parallel execution for performance optimization

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Deployment management for scheduling
   - Storage and caching for scalability
   - API integration for automation

3. **Low Priority**
   - Custom UI components
   - Advanced metrics
   - Complex scheduling patterns

   @flow(name="Your Flow Name")
   def your_flow():
       # Flow implementation
   ```

4. Run your flow:

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       your_flow()
   ```
