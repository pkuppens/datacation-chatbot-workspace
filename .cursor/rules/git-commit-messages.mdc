- Write commit messages in English
- Use first line with type (e.g., "docs:", "fix:", "tests:", "cicd:", "refactor:"), and concise message
- Keep the first line under 120 characters
- Only add a detailed description when necessary:
  * For complex changes that need explanation
  * When fixing a bug that needs context
  * When the change affects multiple components
- If adding a detailed description:
  * Add a blank line after the first line
  * Write the description in full sentences
  * Explain the "why" rather than the "what" and the "how"
