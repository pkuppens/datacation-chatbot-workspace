## File Structure

### 1. Frontmatter
Every MDC file must start with frontmatter containing:
- `description`: A clear, single-line description of the rule's purpose
- `globs`: Array of file patterns where the rule applies
- `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if rule applies globally (optional)

### 2. Content Format
- Use clear, concise language at B2 English level
- Structure content with markdown headings and lists
- Include examples when helpful
- Keep rules specific and actionable

### 3. Rule Types
- Project Management: Guidelines for project documentation and planning
- Language: Writing style and language preferences
- Code Style: Python code formatting and documentation
- Documentation: Markdown and documentation standards
- Git: Commit message and version control practices

### 4. Validation
- All MDC files must have valid frontmatter
- Rules must be clear and actionable
- File patterns in globs must be valid
- Content must follow project's language preferences
