# Language Guidelines

- Use Level B2 English for easy readability, especially for non-native English speakers.
- Exceptions:
  * Jargon and technical terms with specific definitions and meaning.
  * When explicitly asked to respond in a different language.
- Apply the language preference in chat, documentation, generated code, and code comments.
