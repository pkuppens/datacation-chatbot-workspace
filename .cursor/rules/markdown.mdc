Use CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features for headings, lists, links, images, tables, task lists, and fenced code blocks.
Reference: https://github.github.com/gfm/

Use references for online sources used for your documentation.

When asked for project plans or task lists, use checkboxes for enumeration of tasks and subtasks, and a list for the steps.

In markdown files, do not use: HTML, LaTeX/KaTex math, Footnotes.

Expect that markdownlint will be applied.
