# Documentation Insights Guidelines

- Prefer to store insights in project documentation and inline code comments over chat responses.
- If you explain a piece of code, write this as inline code comments near the code, instead of in the chat.
- If you explain a finding or a decision, write this in the markdown documentation files, rather than only chat output.
- The chat can then mention with a concise message that this edit will be made in code comments or project documentation.
- Focus on the "why", only mention the "what" and "how" when necessary.
